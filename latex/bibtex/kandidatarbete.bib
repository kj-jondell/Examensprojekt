	abstract = {It is common for us today to associate the practice of science primarily with the act of seeing—with staring at computer screens, analyzing graphs, and presenting images. We may notice that physicians use stethoscopes to listen for disease, that biologists tune into sound recordings to understand birds, or that engineers have created Geiger tellers warning us for radiation through sound. But in the sciences overall, we think, seeing is believing. This open access book explains why, indeed, listening for knowledge plays an ambiguous, if fascinating, role in the sciences. For what purposes have scientists, engineers and physicians listened to the objects of their interest? How did they listen exactly? And why has listening often been contested as a legitimate form of access to scientific knowledge? This concise monograph combines historical and ethnographic evidence about the practices of listening on shop floors, in laboratories, field stations, hospitals, and conference halls, between the 1920s and today. It shows how scientists have used sonic skills—skills required for making, recording, storing, retrieving, and listening to sound—in ensembles: sets of instruments and techniques for particular situations of knowledge making. Yet rather than pleading for the emancipation of hearing at the expense of seeing, this essay investigates when, how, and under which conditions the ear has contributed to science dynamics, either in tandem with or without the eye.},

Taking inspiration from patterns observed in nature and from some of the principles of jazz bebop improvisation, we have generated Microbial Bebop, a method by which microbial environmental data are transformed into music. Microbial Bebop uses meter, pitch, duration, and harmony to highlight the relationships between multiple data types in complex biological datasets. We use a comprehensive microbial ecology, time course dataset collected at the L4 marine monitoring station in the Western English Channel as an example of microbial ecological data that can be transformed into music. Four compositions were generated (www.bio.anl.gov/{MicrobialBebop}.htm.) from L4 Station data using Microbial Bebop. Each composition, though deriving from the same dataset, is created to highlight different relationships between environmental conditions and microbial community structure. The approach presented here can be applied to a wide variety of complex biological datasets.},

	abstract = {We present the program {PM} for the analysis of protein sequence information using audification. Audification is the technique of using the sense of hearing to analyse data (Jackson, 1993). The advantage of audification over visualisation in data analysis is that sound has the property that when different notes are played together they can still be individually heard: in vision colours blend to form new colours. This distinction can be very useful when studying multivariate data. The one dimensional structure of {DNA} maps naturally onto musical sequences (Hayashi and Munakata, 1984; Ohno and Ohno, 1986). The mapping algorithm in {PM} is designed to translate coding sequences into sound in a way that is more harmonious and more open to analysis than previous methods. The {PM} algorithm uses the {DNA} nucleotide sequence to form the musical top line, and the properties of the translated amino-acids to form the bass line. The notes are in the scale of C Major and there are three beats to the bar. Each codon corresponds to a bar of music and the notes are played on the beat in order of nucleotide sequence. The mapping of the top line to musical notes is as follows: A4 submediant E3 mediant C3 tonic G3 dominant The mapping of the bass line to notes is more complicated and is based on the designation of aminoacid physico-chemical properties of Taylor (1983). Each of the properties has a note assigned to it. The mapping is as follows: polar hydrophobic charged positive aliphatic aromatic tiny},

The {DNA} nucleotide sequence of a gene was employed for the audification. The program assigns the musical note information to each nucleotide using the transformation algorithm and then outputs the {MIDI} sequence as the musical score for a {MIDI} device. Several transformation algorithms were investigated as follows: (1) the simple mapping method that assigns notes to the {DNA} bases. (2) The unique mapping method that assigns the note information with the base usage on the sequence. (3) The musical-theory-based mapping method that is based on the musical theory to get a better musical score.

	abstract = {Single- and multi-agent installations and performances that use physiological signals to establish an interface between music and mental states can be found as early as the mid-1960s. Among these works, many have used physiological signals (or inferred cognitive, sensorimotor or affective states) as media for music generation and creative expression. To a lesser extent, some have been developed to illustrate and study effects of music on the brain. Historically, installations designed for a single participant are most prevalent. Less common are installations that invite participation and interaction between multiple individuals. Implementing such multi-agent installations raises unique challenges, but also unique possibilities for social interaction. Advances in unobtrusive and/or mobile devices for physiological data acquisition and signal processing, as well as computational methods for inferring mental states from such data, have expanded the possibilities for real-world, multi-agent, brain–music interfaces. In this chapter, we examine a diverse selection of playful and social installations and performances, which explore relationships between music and the brain and have featured publically in Mainly Mozart’s annual Mozart \& the Mind ({MATM}) festival in San Diego. Several of these installations leverage neurotechnology (typically novel wearable devices) to infer brain states of participants. However, we also consider installations that solely measure behavior as a means of inferring cognitive state or to illustrate a principle of brain function. In addition to brief overviews of implementation details, we consider ways in which such installations can be useful vehicles, not only for creative expression, but also for education, social interaction, therapeutic intervention, scientific and aesthetic research, and as playful vehicles for exploring human–human and human–machine interaction.},

We propose that by way of critical appropriations of biosensors in artistic practice—that is to say, de- and re-contextualizations of biosensors that acknowledge the shi of ecology and epistemology—artists have a vital role to play in troubling reductive representations of bodies, and furthermore, destabilizing the ethico-æsthetic boundaries of di erently constituted disciplines.},

Workbooks for physical inactivity, osteoporosis, arthritis and high blood pressure also are included on the {CD} Common question-and-answer sections that help patients understand the diseases from which they suffer and encourages them to take responsibility for their health   Exercise and Disease Management, Second Edition consolidates the current knowledge base on exercise and chronic disease, providing a ready-made format for health care providers to use when prescribing exercise programs for their clients. Using guidelines set forth by the American College of Sports Medicine and the American Association of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Rehabilitation, this book helps physicians, other health care providers, and health enthusiasts respond to the challenge to keep patients healthier and active and reduce recurrent hospitalizations and health care costs.},

This critical edition makes available for the first time the core of the research project that spawned the book.In Terrence Gordon’s own words, “{McLuhan} is in full flight already in the introduction, challenging us to plunge with him into what he calls ‘the creative process of knowing.’” Much to the chagrin of his contemporary critics {McLuhan}’s preference was for a prose style that explored rather than explained. Probes, or aphorisms, were an indispensable tool with which he sought to prompt and prod the reader into an “understanding of how media operate” and to provoke reflection.In the 1960s, {McLuhan}’s theories aroused both wrath and admiration. It is intriguing to speculate what he might have to say 40 years later on subjects to which he devoted whole chapters such as Television, The Telephone, Weapons, Housing and Money. Today few would dispute that mass media has indeed decentralized modern living and turned the world into a global village.This critical edition features an appendix that makes available for the first time the core of the research project that spawned the book and individual chapter notes are supported by a glossary of terms, indices of subjects, names, and works cited. There is also a complete bibliography of {McLuhan}’s published works.},
